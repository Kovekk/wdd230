                <p>Our mission at Bountiful Foods is to support local farmers and provide locals 
                    and tourists with convenient access to healthy organic fruit and produce. 
                    Some produce is sourced from (inter)national suppliers, but most of our 
                    products are directly sourced from local farmers. We provide convenient 
                    access to healthy organic food by taking walk-ins at our storefront and food 
                    trucks, where customers can purchase fresh, made-to-order fruit drinks and 
                    fruit bags. We also proide order options both via phone and our website.</p>

                    The storefront of Bountiful Foods first opened on August 27, 2018, located in Carlsbad, 
                    CA at (ADDRESS). Since then, we have added a dozen food trucks, which operate at various 
                    loctions along the coastal region from LA to San Diego.The idea for Bountiful Foods 
                    began when our owner, Paige Turner, noticed that access to healthy organic produce 
                    required frequenting farmers markets and grocery stores. There was a lack of convenient 
                    options for locals and tourists to gain access to fresh organic fruit on-the-go along 
                    the coastal region. Turner decided to solve this problem and follow her passion for 
                    increasing access to healthy organic produce, creating Bountiful Foods.
