            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience for this site has two different parts that are
                described in the site purpose. The first half of the target 
                audience is the business owners of provo. One part of the sites
                purpose is to bring together the local businesses of provo. This
                requires that business owners come to the site and join the chamber
                of commerce. The second half of the target audience is the people of
                provo and any visiters/tourists that could use the services of the 
                businesses that become members of the chamber. This second half
                of the audience will be accessing the site either for historical 
                information through our discover page or to find businesses to 
                support or visit through our discovery page. The end goal is to 
                have people find local businesses and use their services.
